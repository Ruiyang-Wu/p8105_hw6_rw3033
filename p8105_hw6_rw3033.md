Description: The bootstrap distribution of R^2 is slightly right-skewed,
with most values concentrated between 0.89 and 0.92 and a peak near
0.91, indicating a strong and consistent model fit across samples. The
distribution of log(beta0 \* beta1) is symmetric and bell-shaped,
centered around 2.00, suggesting stable relationships between the
intercept and slope across resamples.
